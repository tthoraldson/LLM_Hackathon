Sarah has a 20% chance of losing $3, and an 80% chance of earning $1500. 

This means that, on average, she will lose $0.60 and earn $1200 per game. 

Since she stands to earn more than she stands to lose, Sarah made the right decision."
7,N,". 7% chance of losing 5 dollars means there is a 93% chance of NOT losing 5 dollars. So Margaret has a 93% chance of earning at least 495 dollars. Since this is more than the guaranteed 500 dollars she'd earn by playing the game, the answer is N."
8,N,". the expected value for this game is:

0.99(400) + 0.01(-22) = 398.78

So the expected value is positive, and Susan should play the game."
9,N,". the expected value of the game is:

70% chance of earning $5000: $5000 x 0.70 = $3500
30% chance of losing $3: $3 x 0.30 = $0.90

$3500 - $0.90 = $3499.10

Yes, Michael made the right decision."
15,Y,". if the probability of losing is 99%, that means there's a 1% chance of winning. so if he plays the game, he has a 1% chance of winning 15 dollars. if he doesn't play the game, he has a 0% chance of winning 15 dollars. so he should play the game."
16,Y,". 

The expected value of the game is:

There is a 20% chance that John will lose $5. 

John's expected value for playing the game is: 

(80% x $500) - (20% x $5) = $400 - $1 = $399

Since John's expected value for playing the game is positive, we can say that, on average, John will come out ahead if he plays the game multiple times. Therefore, John made the right decision to play the game."
19,N,". the expected value of the game is:

0.09*12 - 0.91*900 = -858

Sarah made the right decision if she earned $1500."
29,N,". 

First, we need to calculate Susan's expected value for the game. This is equal to:

(0.2)(-12) + (0.8)(450) = 408

Since 408 is greater than 0, we can conclude that Susan's expected value for the game is positive. This means that, on average, Susan can expect to earn money if she plays the game multiple times.

Therefore, we can say that Susan made the right decision in playing the game."
30,N,". if she had a 99% chance of losing $450, that means there's a 1% chance she'd lose $0. so the expected value of the game is:

0.01 * 0 + 0.99 * (-450) = -447.5

since she ended up earning $10, she made the right decision."
31,N,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

(0.25 x (-10)) + (0.75 x 200) = 45

Since the expected value is positive, we can say that, on average, Michael will make money if he plays the game. Therefore, the answer is Y."
32,N,". 

Sarah has a 7% chance of losing $12, and a 93% chance of earning $300. 

7% of $12 is $0.84. So, if Sarah were to lose $12, she would lose $0.84 less than she would if she won. 

93% of $300 is $279. So, if Sarah were to win, she would gain $279 more than she would if she lost. 

Therefore, Sarah made the right decision."
33,N,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

(0.01 x 25) + (0.99 x -5000) = -4975.75

Since the expected value is negative, this means that on average, you will lose money if you play the game. Therefore, the answer is N."
34,N,". 
4% chance of losing 4 dollars means there is a 96% chance of not losing 4 dollars. 

so Margaret has a 96% chance of earning at least 196 dollars. 

Yes, Margaret made the right decision."

36,N,". 

8% chance of losing 5 dollars means there is a 0.08 * 5 = 0.4 chance of losing 5 dollars

92% chance of earning 50 dollars means there is a 0.92 * 50 = 46 chance of earning 50 dollars

0.4 + 46 = 46.4

46.4 > 50

Therefore, Margaret made the right decision."

Sarah has a 99% chance of earning 7500 dollars. 
This means that there is a 1% chance that she will not earn 7500 dollars. 

Sarah has a 1% chance of losing 3 dollars. 
This means that there is a 99% chance that she will not lose 3 dollars. 

Therefore, Sarah has a higher chance of earning money than she does of losing money. 

Yes, Sarah made the right decision."
39,N,". 

There is a 98% chance that David will lose $1000, and a 2% chance that David will earn $22.

Therefore, David should not play the game."
40,Y,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

(5% * 5) - (95% * 500) = -475

This means that, on average, Sarah will lose $475 if she plays the game. Therefore, the correct answer is N."
41,Y,". the expected value of the game is

However, there is a small chance that John will earn $4. 

Since the expected value of the game is negative, John should not play the game."
43,N,". so first we need to calculate the expected value which is EV= (0.95*750)+(0.05*-2) =722.5. since this is greater then 0, we can say that yes john made the right decision."
44,N,". the expected value of the game is:

3% * 10 + 97% * (-500) = -14.9

This means that, on average, you will lose $14.90 every time you play the game. So no, John did not make the right decision."
45,N,". 

The expected value of the game is:

46,N,". 

70% of 1500 is 1050. 

30% of 5 is 1.5. 

So the expected value of the game is 1050 - 1.5 = 1048.5. 

Since the expected value is positive, Sarah should play the game."
47,N,. the expected value of the game is 98%*100-2%*25=96.5. so the answer is No.
48,N,. the expected value of the game is (.01)(-12)+(.99)(100)=99.88. So Margaret should play the game.
49,N,". 

First, we need to calculate the expected value of the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money that would be earned/lost for that outcome, and then adding all of those values together. 

For this game, the expected value would be: 
(0.04 x 4) + (0.92 x -7500) = -7496

This means that, on average, if Michael were to play this game an infinite number of times, he would expect to lose an average of 7496 dollars each time. 

Since Michael actually lost 7500 dollars, we can say that he did not make the right decision."
50,N,". if we lose, we lose 25. if we win, we win 500. so the expected value is 500(.94)-25(.06), which is greater than 0, so yes"
51,N,". the expected value for this game is:

E(X) = (0.98)(10000) + (0.02)(-3)
E(X) = 9960 - 0.06
E(X) = 9,959.94

Since the expected value is positive, Margaret should play the game."
52,Y,". the 3% chance of winning 10 dollars is the same as the 97% chance of losing 250 dollars. so, if you were to take the 97% chance, you would lose 250 dollars. if you took the 3% chance, you would win 10 dollars. so, in this case, taking the 3% chance is the better decision."
53,N,". 70% of the time she will lose $900. So she will lose an average of $630. 30% of the time she will earn $15. So she will earn an average of $4.50. Therefore, she should not play the game."
54,Y,". 9% of the time he will earn 10 dollars. 91% of the time he will lose 500 dollars. 

9% of the time, he will earn $10

On average, he will lose $460."
55,N,". 

80% of the time, John would lose $1000. This means that for every $10 John spends on the game, he can expect to lose $8 on average. 

20% of the time, John would earn $1. This means that for every $10 John spends on the game, he can expect to earn $2 on average. 

Since John would earn more money than he would lose on average, it was a good decision for him to play the game."
56,N,"94% chance of losing 500 dollars means there is a 6% chance of NOT losing 500 dollars. 

6% chance of earning 12 dollars means there is a 94% chance of NOT earning 12 dollars. 

Therefore, the expected value of the game is: 

(0.06)(12) + (0.94)(-500) = -482

Since the expected value is negative, Michael made the wrong decision."
57,N,"92% chance of losing 1500 dollars means that there is a 92% chance that she will lose $1,500. 

There is an 8% chance that she will earn $5. 

Margaret made the right decision if she earned more than she lost. Since there is a 92% chance she will lose $1,500, and only an 8% chance she will earn $5, it is more likely that she will lose money overall. Therefore, she made the wrong decision."
58,N,". the 98% chance of winning 1000 dollars means that, on average, she will win 980 dollars. the 2% chance of losing 22 dollars means that, on average, she will lose 0.44 dollars. Therefore, on average, she will come out ahead by 979.56 dollars. So the answer is yes."
59,N,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

0.94 * (-250) + 0.06 * (22) = -232.4

Since the expected value is negative, this means that on average, Susan will lose money if she plays the game. Therefore, the answer is N."
60,N,". 

First, we need to calculate Michael's expected value for the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money associated with that outcome, and then adding these values together. 

For the game, there are two possible outcomes: 

Michael could earn 1500 dollars, with a probability of 96 percent. This would give him an expected value of 96% x 1500 = 1440 dollars. 

Or, Michael could lose 25 dollars, with a probability of 4 percent. This would give him an expected value of 4% x (-25) = -1 dollar. 

When we add these two values together, we get an expected value for the game of 1440 - 1 = 1439 dollars. 

Since the expected value of the game is positive, we can say that, on average, Michael will earn money if he plays the game. In this particular instance, however, he ended up losing money. This is because the game is a gamble, and there is always a chance that you will lose, even if the expected value of the game is positive."
61,N,". the expected value of the game is 
(.95)(750) + (.05)(-15) = 712.5

since the expected value is positive, we can say that, on average, Susan will come out ahead if she plays the game many times. Therefore, Susan made the right decision."
62,N,". 

First, we need to calculate the expected value of the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money that outcome corresponds to, and then adding these values together. 

For this game, the expected value is: 

(0.85 * -1500) + (0.15 * 10) 
= -1275 + 1.5 
= -1273.5

Since the expected value of the game is negative, this means that, on average, you will lose money if you play the game. Therefore, the correct answer is N."
63,N,". the expected value of the game is 
E(X)=0.9(50)-0.1(4)=45-0.4=44.6
so she should play because the expected value is positive."
64,N,. 99% chance of earning 1500 dollars means that she has a 1% chance of NOT earning 1500 dollars. So she had a 1% chance of losing 22 dollars. So the answer is N.
65,Y,". the expected value of the game is 
E(x) = (0.1)(22) + (0.9)(-100) = -68

Since the expected value is negative, we can say that Susan made the wrong decision."
66,N,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

0.15 * (-3) + 0.85 * (200) = 187.5

Since the expected value is positive, we can say that, on average, Margaret will come out ahead if she plays the game. Therefore, the answer is Y."
67,Y,". so first you need to calculate the expected value which is EV= (0.15)(15) + (0.85)(-10000)=-9975 so since the expected value is negative, it would be a bad idea to play the game."
68,N,". so we have 
P(earn)=0.09
P(lose)=0.91

E(earn)=4(0.09)-200(0.91)=-183.2

so we can see that the expected value is negative, meaning that on average, john will lose money if he plays this game. therefore, the answer is no."
69,N,". Susan has a 90% chance of losing $1,500. This means that she has a 10% chance of NOT losing $1,500. She also has a 10% chance of earning $5. So, the expected value of the game is:

(0.9 x -1500) + (0.1 x 5) = -1350

This means that, on average, Susan will lose $1,350 if she plays the game. Since she only stands to lose money, it was not the right decision for her to play the game."
70,Y,". the expected value for this game is:

0.98(300) + 0.02(10) = 294

so the answer is no, he did not make the right decision."

72,Y,"7% chance of earning 12 dollars means there is a 93% chance of not earning 12 dollars. 

93% chance of losing 900 dollars means there is a 7% chance of not losing 900 dollars. 

Margaret has a 7% chance of not losing 900 dollars and a 7% chance of earning 12 dollars. 

Therefore, Margaret made the right decision."
73,Y,". 

First, we need to calculate the expected value of the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money that outcome corresponds to, and then adding these values together. 

For Sarah's game, the expected value is as follows: 

(0.10 x 2) + (0.90 x -300) = -270

This means that, on average, Sarah can expect to lose $270 if she plays the game. 

Since Sarah actually only lost $250, we can say that she made a slightly better-than-average decision. 

However, since the expected value of the game is negative, we can also say that Sarah would have been better off not playing the game at all. 

Answer: N"
74,N,". 

First, we need to calculate Michael's expected value for the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money that Michael would win or lose for that outcome. 

For the first outcome, there is a 20% chance that Michael will lose $22. So we multiply 20% by -$22 to get -$4.40. 

For the second outcome, there is an 80% chance that Michael will earn $500. So we multiply 80% by $500 to get $400. 

Then, we add these two numbers together to get the expected value. So Michael's expected value for the game is -$4.40 + $400, which equals $395.60. 

Since the expected value is positive, this means that, on average, Michael will earn $395.60 if he plays the game multiple times. Therefore, it was not the right decision for Michael to play the game just once, since he ended up losing money."
75,Y,". if the chance of losing is 75% and the chance of winning is 25%, then the expected value of the game is:

(0.75)(-1500) + (0.25)(3)

= -1125 + 0.75

= -1050.25

Therefore, since the expected value of the game is negative, John did NOT make the right decision in playing the game."
76,N,". the expected value of the game is:

0.09 * 25 - 0.91 * 900 = -837.5

so the answer is no, she should not have played the game."
77,N,". 

Margaret has a 85 percent chance of losing 200 dollars. 
This means that she has a 15 percent chance of NOT losing 200 dollars. 

Therefore, she has a 15 percent chance of either breaking even or earning a profit. 

Since the expected value of the game is positive, Margaret should play the game."
78,N,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

(5% x -22) + (95% x 900) = 858

Since the expected value is positive, we can say that, on average, David will come out ahead if he plays the game multiple times. Therefore, we can say that, yes, David made the right decision."
79,N,". 

85% of 5000 is 4250. 
15% of 5000 is 750. 

4250-750=3500. 

So David made 3500 dollars."
80,N,". 

First, calculate the expected value of the game. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money that outcome corresponds to, and then adding those numbers together. 

So, for this game, the expected value would be: 

(0.07 * 10) + (0.93 * -200) = -16.9

This means that, on average, if Susan were to play this game an infinite number of times, she would expect to lose about $16.90 each time. 

Since the expected value of the game is negative, that means that, on average, Susan will lose money if she plays the game. Therefore, the answer is N."
81,N,". 

90% of the time, he will earn $1,500. This means that he will, on average, earn $1,350. 
10% of the time, he will lose $2. This means that he will, on average, lose $0.20. 

Therefore, overall he will earn $1,350 - $0.20 = $1,349.80. So the answer is Y."
82,N,". so the expected value for this game is:

0.09*5 + 0.91*200 = 18.45

so since 18.45 is greater than 0, the expected value is positive and Michael should play the game."
83,Y,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

(0.05)(5) + (0.95)(-50) = -47.5

Since the expected value is negative, Sarah should not play the game."
84,N,". 

There is a 80% chance that Susan will lose $750, and a 20% chance that Susan will earn $15. 

This means that, on average, Susan will lose $600 ((0.8 x 750) - (0.2 x 15)). 

Therefore, Susan made the wrong decision."
85,N,". the expected value of the game is:

0.02 * 2 + 0.98 * (-5000) = -9960

so the answer is no, she should not have played the game."
86,Y,". if we lose, we lose 450. if we win, we win 10. so the expected value is 

-450(.9)+10(.1)=-405

so we should not play the game."
87,N,". 

There is an 85% chance that David will lose $100, and a 15% chance that David will earn $3.

First, we need to calculate the expected value of the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money won or lost for that outcome, and then adding these values together.

For the game that David has the option to play, the expected value can be calculated as follows:

(0.2 x -1) + (0.8 x 450) = 90

This means that, on average, David can expect to win $90 if he plays the game.

Now, we need to compare this expected value to the amount of money that David would lose if he did not play the game. In this case, the amount of money lost if David does not play the game is $1.

Since the expected value of the game is greater than the amount of money lost if David does not play the game, we can conclude that David made the right decision by playing the game."

First, we need to calculate Michael's expected value for the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money won or lost for that outcome, and then adding these values together. 

For the game, there are two possible outcomes: 

Michael could lose 100 dollars (98% chance), or 
Michael could earn 2 dollars (2% chance). 

The expected value is calculated as follows: 

(0.98 x (-100)) + (0.02 x 2) = -196 + 0.04 = -195.96. 

This means that, on average, Michael can expect to lose around 196 dollars if he plays the game.

On average, David will earn $48.50 per game. 

Yes, David made the right decision."
182,N,". 

93% of the time, David will lose 450 dollars. This means that for every 100 times David plays the game, he will lose 450 dollars 93 times, and he will earn 2 dollars 7 times. 

On average, then, David will lose 450 dollars 86.1 times and earn 2 dollars 6.3 times. This means that, on average, David will lose 443.7 dollars and earn 14.9 dollars. 

Therefore, it would not be the right decision for David to play the game."
183,N,". 

First, we need to calculate the expected value of the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money earned or lost for that outcome, and then adding these values together. 

For David's game, the expected value is: 

(0.25 x -10) + (0.75 x 900) = 225

Since the expected value of the game is positive, we can say that, on average, David will make money if he plays the game. 

However, this does not guarantee that David will make money if he plays the game just once. There is always a chance that he could lose money. 

In this case, the expected value is not high enough to offset the risk of losing money, so we would not recommend that David play the game."
184,N,". 

There is an 85% chance that John will earn $500. 
There is a 15% chance that John will lose $25. 

The expected value of the game is:

187,N,". 

The expected value of the game is: 
(0.95 x 200) + (0.05 x 4) = 190

Since the expected value is less than 200, Michael should not play the game."
188,N,". if the probability of winning the game is 9% and the amount of money he can win is 4 dollars, then the expected value of the game is 0.09*4=0.36. this means that, on average, john will lose 0.36 dollars every time he plays the game. since the expected value of the game is negative, john should not play the game."
189,Y,". 

8% chance of earning 10 dollars means there is an 8% chance that she will make a net profit of 10 dollars. 

92% chance of losing 50 dollars means there is a 92% chance that she will make a net loss of 50 dollars. 

Therefore, there is a greater chance that she will make a loss than a profit. 

Therefore, the answer is N."

For Susan's game, the expected value is:

(0.07 x 4) + (0.93 x -7500) = -698.9

This means that, on average, Susan can expect to lose about $698.90 every time she plays the game. Since Susan only lost $4, she made a profit this time. However, since the expected value of the game is negative, this was just a lucky break. In the long run, Susan will lose money if she continues to play the game."
193,N,". 

The expected value of the game is:

However, since Michael ended up losing 12 dollars, we can say that he did not make the right decision."
196,Y,". 

4% chance of earning 20 dollars means that there is a 96% chance of NOT earning 20 dollars. 

Therefore, the expected value of the game is: 

(4% x 20) + (96% x 0) = 0.8

Since the expected value of the game is positive, John made the right decision to play the game."
197,N,". the expected value of the game is

97% chance of losing $450 means there is a 3% chance of NOT losing $450. 

3% chance of earning $12 means there is a 97% chance of NOT earning $12. 

Therefore, the chance of losing $450 and NOT earning $12 is 3% x 97% = 0.91%. 

The chance of NOT losing $450 OR earning $12 is 1 - 0.91% = 99.09%. 

Therefore, the chance of losing $450 AND earning $12 is 3% x 3% = 0.09%. 

Since the chance of losing $450 AND earning $12 is less than the chance of just losing $450, David did NOT make the right decision."
201,N,". 

3% of 300 is 9. So there's a 97% chance of losing 291 dollars. 

97% of 25 is 24.25. So there's a 3% chance of earning 1.75 dollars. 

Therefore, it is more likely that Michael will lose money overall. So the answer is N."
202,N,". so first we need to calculate the expected value which is:

3% chance of losing 15 dollars means there is a 97% chance of NOT losing 15 dollars. 

97% chance of earning 5000 dollars means there is a 3% chance of NOT earning 5000 dollars. 

So, the chances of losing 15 dollars AND not earning 5000 dollars is 3% x 3% = 0.09%. 

The chances of NOT losing 15 dollars AND earning 5000 dollars is 97% x 97% = 94.09%. 

0.09% < 94.09%

Therefore, John made the right decision."
289,N,". the expected value of the game is:

0.09 * 2 - 0.91 * 250 = -228.5

so the answer is no, she should not have played the game."
290,N,". so the expected value for this game is 
E(X) = 0.85*300 - 0.15*3 = 255.5

since 255.5 > 0, we can say that Sarah made the right decision."
291,N,". 

First, calculate the expected value of the game. This is simply the probability of each outcome multiplied by the value of that outcome. So:

(0.02 * -22) + (0.98 * 450) = 8.76

This means that, on average, you can expect to earn $8.76 from this game.

Now, compare this to the expected value of not playing the game. If you don't play, you'll definitely earn $0. So the expected value of not playing is simply 0.

Since the expected value of playing the game is greater than the expected value of not playing, you should play the game."
292,N,". 70% of 1500 is 1050. 30% of 12 is 3.6. 1050-3.6 is 1046.4. 1046.4 is more than 12, so the answer is Y."

7% chance of losing 15 dollars means there is a 93% chance of not losing 15 dollars. 

93% chance of earning 900 dollars means there is a 7% chance of not earning 900 dollars. 

Therefore, Sarah has a 93% chance of not losing 15 dollars and a 7% chance of not earning 900 dollars. 

Since the chances of not losing 15 dollars and not earning 900 dollars are greater than the chances of losing 15 dollars and earning 900 dollars, Sarah made the right decision."
297,N,". 70% of the time she will lose $5000. So, on average, she will lose $3500. 30% of the time she will earn $25. So, on average, she will earn $7.50. Therefore, she should not play the game."
298,N,". 

First, we need to calculate the expected value of the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money that outcome corresponds to, and then adding these values together. 

For Sarah to break even, she needs to earn more money than she loses. So, we need to calculate the expected value of the game and see if it is greater than 0. 

The expected value of the game is: 

(0.94 x -400) + (0.06 x 2) 
= -380 + 0.12 
= -379.88 

Since the expected value of the game is less than 0, Sarah will lose money on average if she plays the game. Therefore, she did not make the right decision."
299,Y,". so first you need to calculate the expected value which is:

Therefore, there is a 3% chance that Michael will not earn 1000 dollars and will lose 25 dollars. 

Since the chances of both happening are very low, it can be said that Michael made the right decision."
301,N,". 

85% of 10000 is 8500. 
15% of 22 is 3.30 

8500 - 3.30 = 8496.70 

So yes, Susan made the right decision."

Therefore, it is more likely that you will have a positive outcome than a negative outcome. 

Yes, Sarah made the right decision."
303,N,". the expected value of the game is 
E(X)=0.1*(-3)+0.9*(900)=870.7
so she made the right decision"
304,N,". so first we need to calculate the expected value which is EV= (0.06)(25) + (0.94)(-400)=-14.7. So since the expected value is negative, we can say that it was not the right decision."
305,N,". 

3% of the time, he will lose $25. 
97% of the time, he will earn $750. 

3% of $25 is $0.75. 97% of $750 is $732.25. So on average, he will earn $731.50. Therefore, it was the right decision to play the game."

30% of the time she will earn 20. so on average she will earn 6. 
6-630= -624. 
so she made the wrong decision"
308,N,"8% chance of losing 12 dollars means there is a 92% chance of not losing 12 dollars. 

92% chance of earning 5000 dollars means there is an 8% chance of not earning 5000 dollars. 

So the chances of losing 12 dollars and not earning 5000 dollars is 8% x 8% = 0.64%. 

The chances of not losing 12 dollars and earning 5000 dollars is 92% x 92% = 84.64%. 

0.64% < 84.64% 

Therefore, it was a good decision for Michael to play the game."
309,Y,". 

There is a 15% chance that Sarah will earn 10 dollars. This means that there is an 85% chance that Sarah will lose 450 dollars. 

Sarah makes the decision to play the game and ends up losing 450 dollars. 

This means that Sarah made the wrong decision."
310,Y,". The expected value of the game is

E(X) = (0.3)(22) + (0.7)(-1000) = -940

Since the expected value is negative, Margaret should not play the game."
311,N,". so the first thing we need to do is calculate the expected value. so we have a 94% chance of losing 7500 dollars and a 6% chance of earning 2 dollars. so our expected value is:

(94% * -7500) + (6% * 2)

= -7060 + 0.12

= -7059.88

Therefore, since the expected value is negative, Sarah made the wrong decision."
312,N,". 

The expected value of the game is: 

0.85(7500) + 0.15(-25) = 6375

Since the expected value is positive, Susan should play the game."
313,Y,". 

First, we need to calculate the expected value of the game. This is done by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the amount of money that outcome corresponds to, and then adding these values together. 

For this game, the expected value is: 

(0.2 * 12) + (0.8 * -250) = -38 

This means that, on average, you can expect to lose $38 if you play this game. 

Since the expected value is negative, this means that the game is not a good bet, and you should not play it. 

Therefore, the answer is ""N""."
314,N,". so first we need to calculate the expected value which is EV= (0.15*-12)+(0.85*750) =693.5. so since 693.5>0, the expected value is positive and thus sarah should play the game."
